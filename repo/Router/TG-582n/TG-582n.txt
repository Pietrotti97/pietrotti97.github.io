This is the readme file for the TG-582n adsl modem+router.
Two different baords revision, the only difference is the SPI:

-DATNT-T: 8MB Spi (Some older Fastweb boards)
-DANT-1: 16MB Spi (Usually Telecom Italia boards, also called AGTWI)

Tools used: 

-Ch341a_spi programmer
-Uart adapter

Cfe must be flashed via spi programmer, I used flashrom under linux

Then, via CFE WebUI flash the OpenWRT Image.

For the DANT-1 the BILLION firmware for the BPAC 7800NL is the best solution to have a perfectly working ADSL modem+router

To flash the Billion FW, you must change the CFE. There is a perfectly fine cfe in the Comtrend AR-5382u Firmwre image.
Flash first the AR image, then the Billion image

NOTE: the leds does not work correctly with the BILLION fimware
