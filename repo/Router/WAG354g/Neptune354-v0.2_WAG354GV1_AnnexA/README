   FAQ

Q: How can I know that this is the right firmware version for my router model?

A: Every firmware has a identifier called code pattern, that is related to a specific hardware version and Annex. You can see the code pattern simply opening the firmware file with an hex editor.
The first 4 bytes are the code pattern identifier.

HG1B                   |          Linksys HG200       AnnexB


Q: Flashing a wrong firmware version will brick my router?

A: No, if you try to flash a firmware version with a wrong code pattern, the router will refuse to do it.
   Anyway a correct code pattern does not imply a good/working firmware.
